# Hackathon: Schelling Point Virtual Hackathon
### Submision for üèÖ Create GitcoinDAO-Themed POAP Templates

I created 3 templates for 3 roles:
- Stewards (color green)
- Contributors (color purple)
- Members (color yellow)

Each template containts 3 labels:
1. One at the top describing the role (Steward, Contributor or Member)
2. One in the middle which can be used as a date (see member and contributor example below) or to add extra information (see stweard example below).
3. One at the bottom which can be used to describe and action (see member example below) or to complete the information provided by label 2.

I'm not sure what the official font of gitcoin is, for this submission I used 'Miriam Libre'.

Any kind of change is possible on request.
